For descriptions of codes, refer to folders "ipynd" for Jupyter Notebook version and "markdown" for MarkDown version.&nbsp; 
In both versions the contents are the same, however, since Github does not support LaTex, use the "ipynb" version if you wish to view online.&nbsp;
If you have cloned the project and uses editors that support LaTex, then the "markdown" version is is more readable.&nbsp;
