For descriptions of codes, refer to folders "ipynd" for Jupyter Notebook version and "markdown" for MarkDown version.

In both versions the contents are the same, however, since Github does not support LaTex, use the "ipynb" version if you wish to view online.

If you have cloned the project and uses editors that support LaTex, then the "markdown" version is is more readable.

### Dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy metworkx matplotlib pyvis
```
